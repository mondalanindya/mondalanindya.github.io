        <h1>Anindya Mondal</h1>
        <aside>Welcome to my personal website! <!-- I am Anindya, a postgraduate researcher at the <a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/artificial-intelligence/about">Surrey Institute for People-Centred AI</a>, <a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/centre-vision-speech-signal-processing">University of Surrey</a>.</aside> -->
        <p>I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering (Hons.) degree in Electronics and Telecommunication from <a href="https://jadavpuruniversity.in/">Jadavpur University</a>, India, where I collaborated with some remarkable researchers from institutions like the Indian Institute of Science, La Rochelle Université and Télécom Paris.</p>
        <p>My research focus is in the areas of machine learning, computer vision, and the internet of things, with a current emphasis on video representation learning by vision-language modeling. I have also delved into the realms of graph neural networks, graph signal processing, and subspace clustering.</p>
        <p>The best way to get in touch with me is by emailing me at <a href="mailto:anindyam.jan@gmail.com">anindyam[dot]jan[at]gmail[dot]com.</a> I rarely check my other social media accounts (like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anindyamondal2001/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/anindyamondal01">Twitter</a>, and others), so messages sent there may go unnoticed.</p>
        <p>I am not a photogenic person, so I avoid posting my photos in public. However, here's <a href ="https://imgur.com/a/lpZvmEe">one</a> clicked on the 31st of Dec 2022 at the <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Eye_Pier">London Eye Pier</a>.
